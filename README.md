## 💼 About Me

I'm a data enthusiast with a strong interest in AI applications, machine learning, and the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs). My focus areas include LLM fine-tuning, building intelligent systems, and using data to drive meaningful outcomes.

Outside of traditional data science work, I also explore the creative side of AI. I design and sell AI-generated art via my Instagram page, blending technology and creativity to produce original visual content.

This project showcases my ability to:

Analyze real-world data for career insights

Visualize trends and skill demands

Communicate technical findings clearly

I'm always learning and exploring new tools at the intersection of AI, automation, and design — with the goal of contributing to innovative, human-centered solutions.
