# The Analysis
## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysis
![Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in the US](3_Project/images/trending_top_skills.png)
*This plot illustrates the trending top skills required for Data Analyst positions in the US throughout 2023. SQL consistently ranks as the most in-demand skill, maintaining a high presence of over 50% in job postings across all months. Although there is a slight downward trend in the latter half of the year, SQL remains a foundational requirement for data analyst roles, underlining its critical role in data extraction and manipulation.

Excel shows a relatively stable demand in the first half of the year, with a noticeable increase around July and August, peaking at about 45%. However, it dips again in the fall before rebounding slightly by December. This fluctuation may indicate that employers rely more on Excel during mid-year reporting periods or budget planning cycles. Python, meanwhile, remains steady but slightly declines in demand, hinting that while it is important, it's often supplemented or replaced by other specialized tools depending on the job scope.

Tableau and Power BI, both data visualization tools, show consistently lower demand compared to other skills. Tableau sees minor fluctuations with a slight rise mid-year before dipping again, while Power BI remains the least in-demand skill, staying under 25% throughout. These trends suggest that while data visualization is important, employers may prefer candidates who can combine visualization skills with data manipulation and analysis, such as those offered by SQL or Excel.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysis?

### Salary Analysis
#### Visualize Data
```

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) # Set size: make nice and big

sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)


plt.title('Salary Distributions in the United States')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')

ticks_x = FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y / 1000)}K')  # Note: divide by 1000, not 100
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US](3_Project/images/salary_distribution_US.png)

 Insights from U.S. Salary Distributions for Top Data Roles
Senior-level roles (e.g., Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) consistently earn higher median salaries compared to their junior counterparts.

Data Scientists and Data Engineers show a wider salary range and more outliers, indicating high variability in compensation ‚Äî likely influenced by company size, location, or seniority.

Outliers are present across all roles, with some salaries exceeding $500K and even approaching $1M ‚Äî possibly reflecting executive-level or Silicon Valley positions.

Data Analysts (including Senior) tend to have lower median salaries and narrower distributions, suggesting more standardized compensation bands.

Overall, salary distributions are right-skewed, with long tails indicating a small number of very high earners in each role.
